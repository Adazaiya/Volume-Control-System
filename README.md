Our goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly Volume Control System using Verilog HDL on the DE1-SoC FPGA board. It is designed to address the need for real-time audio control, combining hardware efficiency with user interaction. The project provides objectives such as:

## Dynamic Volume Control:
Users can adjust the audio output between eight levels (1 to 8) to manage sound intensity. 

## Microphone Muting:
The logic ensures silence when needed, with automatic restoration of the last volume level when unmuted.

## Headphone Channel Selection:
Switches allow users to select either the left or right headphone channel for output, with LEDs acting as visual indicators for the currently active channel.

## Real-Time Feedback:
HEX displays show the current volume level, while LEDs provide additional status information like muted state and channel selection.
